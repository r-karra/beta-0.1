# About Me

I am a data scientist focused on AI applications.  While this often means machine learning and deep learning it often means web app development and other things.  AI is only a component of a successful AI application.

I am currently builing out Gallery.FastHT.ML](https://gallery.fastht.ml/) and generally developing the FastHTML ecosystem.

My primary hobby is dance.  I used to teach ballroom dance full time, which is where I met my partner.  My partner runs her own [dance instruction business](https://artofmovementdc.com/) here in D.C.

Here's a couple casual demos we did together: [social](https://youtu.be/nUdMfll0YJo) and [routine](https://youtu.be/Y7R82kgeUbY)

# üë®‚Äçüíª How to get into data science üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

I recommend working through the [fastai courses](https://course.fast.ai/).  These are fantastic courses that teach great content, but also in an approachable way that enable you to use what your learn on real problems right away.

**Tinker with everything.**  Try to never ask "Would it work if I did X?" or "Can I accomplish X by doing Y?".  Instead, try it and see if it works.  It's worth the time investment.

**Do projects**  Do projects in parallel with courses, and after courses.  Don't wait.  Build stuff.  Doing projects should be where you put most of your time.

**Teach to learn**  Teaching is a great way to learn, and if you have a record of it you build a portfolio at the same time!  I am a fan of doing this via blogging [for many reasons](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).  See [my FAQ](other/bloggingFAQ.qmd) for some help getting started.

**Keep at it** and be tenacious.  There is discomfort with learning any skill. You'll be frustrated at times.  That's a sign that there's a concept worth learning and once you do figure it out you'll have made a big step forward.
