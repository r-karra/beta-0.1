    "\n",
    "Now-a-days all my presentations are really Quarto html outputs that I walk through with clients.  I can now add sections of notes for myself that I don't want the client to see.   Lots of things I will use this for such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Documenting some nuance about why I did something that isn't relevant to business users\n",
    "+ Notes to look into some data issue if the project gets approved\n",

    "\n",
    "[nbdev](nbdev.fast.ai) is a tool to write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles â€” all in one place, your notebook.  It takes notebooks and outputs documentation and a python library.  This is great because now in the same place I can write development notes or to-do's right in the place where the code/tests/docs are sourced from.  Maybe a note for myself or for other developers in full markdown that won't get rendered to the user documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Website/Blogs\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it'll be really nice to have notes on blogs.  Sometimes I go back and improve old blogs, or add sections.  I try not to let not being \"finished\" prevent me from posting.  Once I have something I think is good it ships, even if there's more I could do.  Because there's always more I can do.  Being able to add the to-do's to myself for when I come back later will be fantastic!"
