His passion for knowledge and practical skills across many aspects of the data/analytics/data sciences realm has made him one of the most well-rounded data practitioners I have worked with. He brings a perspective that continuously feels unique yet is grounded in a practicality that always yields results. There are many aspects of his skill, knowledge, and personality I could speak highly of, but feel I can summarize it best by saying if I had to pick one individual to assist me in tackling an unknown data-related problem/engagement, large or small, it would probably be Isaac.\n",

This voluntary effort enables Isaac to bring innovative ideas and approaches to each initiative that routinely enable outcomes to be better than originally imagined.

He is able to walk me through things I don‚Äôt understand and explain them in effective way, while also showing me the path to go above and beyond.  Often these new directions are ones I never would have discovered myself.  This has been true while working under him in a professional setting as well as when discussing ideas and techniques while working alongside him on personal projects. The selfless support he shows his friends may is as impressive as the initiative and drive he shows in his own work.  I am truly excited to see what Isaac achieves in the future!\n",
