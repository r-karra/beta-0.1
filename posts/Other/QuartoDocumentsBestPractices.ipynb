    "## Quarto Benefits\n",
    "+ Version control is very nice for presentations\n",
    "+ Text, docs, code ouputs, plots, code, tests all in one place.\n",
    "+ Easy to make really good looking outputs\n",
    "+ Learn one tool for lots of formats - documents, presentations, websites, development\n",
    "+ Rendering to html is a option for sharing.  It's more powerful than pdf and everyone can open it in their browser.\n",

This is useful for limiting what's shows on the screen and gives a really high quality feel above and beyond a pdf document.  Use it to organize and make your document clearer and less static.\n",
