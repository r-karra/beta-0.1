## What if I am not ready?

Writing your first post can be intimidating.  **The most important thing is to write a post**.  If you only do things you are completely ready for you will not develop and grow as quickly

A few things to keep in mind:

+ Very few people like feel confident about the quality of their first article.  That's OK, and totally normal.  
+ It takes time to develop a skill.  It's completely unreasonable for you to expect the first article you write on a technical topic to be world-class quality.  It's normal to not feel confident in the quality of your first
+ You don't have to write about groundbreaking research or topics.  In fact, the most popular articles are often simple topics and write-ups that help those just breaking into a field get their start!
+ The topic of your first blog post doesn't matter much.  I'd recommend doing something easy to figure out how to do the full blogging process and start building the habit!

## Is there anything I should read before starting?

I highly recommend writing these 2 posts:

+ [Why you, yes you should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)
+ [Advice for better blog posts](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2019-05-13-blogging-advice.html)

### How do I pick a topic?

Here's how I generally pick my blog post topics.

+ Something you recently learned
+ Something you do a lot of or use frequently
+ Something you want to learn
+ A write up of a project you did recently
+ Rewrite a blog post or article in way that is more intuitive to you (give credit to original article!)
+ Take a blog post and expand on details or add information they didn't cover on the topic (give credit to original article!)

### What do I say about my topic?

Pick 1 or 2.  But don't try to do all of these in the same post.  You could have multiple posts about the same topic that cover these different angles though!

+ Explain your topic in plain English and intuitively why it works or is useful
+ What's the simplest way to use/apply your topic effectively?
+ Show examples of how you would use your topic in practice
+ What are alternative ways of accomplishing the same thing?  What are the pro/con of the different approaches?
+ Pick functionality from an open source library you find useful and explain how/why it works in detail
+ What are all the parameters you can control?  What are the design decisions?  How might they be affected by what a business needs?  When would this be useful to a person or business?

### Who's my audience?

+ Write a tutorial or resource for your future self.  If you don't think about this topic for the next year, what's the resource would that help you get back up to speed and refresh your memory?  There are people out there in that exact situation that it would help!
+ Write a tutorial or resource for your past self.  What's the resource that you wish had existed when you were learning about this topic that would have made learning it easier?  There are people out there like you that this will help!

My recommendation is to create a blog using quarto.  [See this tutorial that walks you through setting it up]( https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
